# DEVLOG

Only append. Do not edit old sections. Two samples stay so students can see the format.

Only changes to the game itself are logged: the verb, win and loss, pressure, and what the player can feel.
Site language, diagram styling, and click-to-read-script do not go into an Interaction or a Stage Reflection.

Each gameplay change should add a section `## Interaction NNN — title` (the Agent can append this when it changes the game).
Add `## Stage Reflection NNN — title` only when you ask for one: Keep / Change / Cut, and which AI suggestions you accepted or rejected. That reflection stays on the game.

## Interaction 000 — EXAMPLE (sample, do not delete)

- Date: —
- Who asked: teacher (sample)
- Request: Tighten one tunable and see if it is still the same game.
- What changed: Sample only. The current code was not changed. A real change would touch only one `@tune` field.
- Result: The player's verb did not change. Win and loss did not change. Pressure changed, not the skeleton.

## Stage Reflection 000 — EXAMPLE (sample, do not delete)

### Keep
- A core verb you can say in one sentence, and a clear win/loss.

### Change
- To make it harder, turn an existing `@tune` first. Do not add a new system yet.

### Cut
- No shop, no deep inventory, no optimization that is off-lesson.

### AI
- Accept: tune feel with existing fields; avoid opening new scripts.
- Reject: GraphView, object pools, long hand-written scene YAML. This class is about script relationships and tunable numbers.
